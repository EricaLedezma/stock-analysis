# stock-analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this assigment was to analyze stock data for the years 2017 and 2018. We wrote code that provides an interactive and easy to ready graph that shows companies that are performing positively and negatively. The user can then decide which ones would be good to invest in.

With this assignment, we wrote the code and then were challenged to refactor it to have code that is more efficient, concise, and easier to read.

## Results
Here are the results for the year 2017:

Here are the results for the year 2018:

## Summary

1. What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

- Some of the advantages of refactored code: more efficient, less code which takes up less memory, easier for future users to read. 
- A disadvantage of refactoring is the trade-off - how much the reduced runtime for the code from the original to the refactored code was miniscule. Is is worth putting in the time to refactor if the coded barely runs faster?


2. How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

- Unfortunately, I did not get a screenshot of my runtime for the code before I refactored it. So, I cannot see if the refactored code significantly reduced the runtime.
